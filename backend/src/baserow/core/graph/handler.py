class BaseGraphHandler(ABC):
    """
    The base handler to support all automation workflow and application builder graph
    operations. Most operation over the graph structure should happen here.

    The structure looks like:

    ```
    {
        "0": 1,
        "1": {"next": {"": [2]}},
        "2": {
            "next": {
                "uuid1": [3],
                "uuid2": [5],
                "": [4],
            }
        },
        "3": {},
        "5": {},
        "4": {"next": {"": [6]}},
        "6": {"children": {"": [7], "0": [8], "1": [9]}},
        "7": {},
        "8": {},
        "9": {"next": {"": [10]}},
        "10": {}
    }
    ```

    The key is the ID of a point, except for the key '0' that indicates the ID of the
    first point of the graph.

    For each point, `next` is the dict keyed by edge UUIDs and valued by the list of
    point ID on this edge. For now only one point is possible per output.

    `children` is a dict keyed by edge/place identifiers and valued by lists of child
    point IDs. This allows container elements to have children at different "places"
    (e.g., different columns or slots). The "" (empty string) key represents the
    default edge.

    For backwards compatibility, `children` may also be a simple array (legacy format):
    `{"children": [7]}` is treated as `{"children": {"": [7]}}`.

    This graph structure uses triplets to identify the position of a point.
    A triplet looks like [reference_point, position, output].

    For instance:
    - [<Point(42)>, 'south', ''] refers to the point placed at the
      south of the point 42 at default output "".
    - [<Point(42)>, 'south', 'uuid45'] refers to the point placed at the
      south of the point 42 at the edge with uid `uuid45`.
    - [<Point(42)>, 'child', ''] refers to the point placed as child of the
      point 42 at the default edge.
    - [<Point(42)>, 'child', '0'] refers to the point placed as child of the
      point 42 at edge/place "0".
